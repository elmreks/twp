Lyrics
[Intro]
Yeah
North Beach
OSHA never saw this comin’
Yeah
[Chorus]
Rollin’ down Vallejo in an office chair
White boy unhinged, don’t give a fuck, don’t care
Five wheels screamin’, sparks in the air
Whole block like “what the fuck is that?”
Office chair gangster, life too raw
Hard livin’ motherfucker, dented soul
Can’t stop now, I’m already there
Yeah, I fuck shit up in an office chair
[Verse 1]
I ain’t pushin’ papers, I’m pushin’ fate
Downhill menace, smile full of hate
Tie gone missing, shirt got paint
Knees all scraped but I still don’t brake
White boy reckless, earned that name
Life tried to box me, cracked the frame
From barstools, courtrooms, survival mode
Still roll dirty, heavy load
Bills on my mind, beer on my breath
Chair got wobble but I cheat death
They say “yo, you good?” I say “yeah”
Then I roll past fear in an office chair
[Chorus]
Rollin’ down Vallejo in an office chair
White boy unhinged, don’t give a fuck, don’t care
Five wheels screamin’, sparks in the air
Whole block like “what the fuck is that?”
Office chair gangster, legend in flight
Hard livin’ motherfucker bombin’ hills at night
Can’t slow down, I’m already there
Yeah, I fuck shit up in an office chair
[Bridge]
They say slow down
I say nah
They say act right
I say ha
Life said sit down
I said watch this
Rolled past destiny
Middle finger ballistic
[Verse 2]
No engine, still got torque
One kick off the curb make the city go “oh fuck”
Streetlights blink when I pass through
Even pigeons scatter when I move
This ain’t cosplay, this ain’t cute
This is years of “fuck you” breakin’ loose
Weaponized gravity, bad decisions
Therapy with consequences
Same with life, same with stress
Push it down till it makes a mess
I face mine head on, no despair
Clear the lane in an office chair
[Chorus]
Rollin’ down Vallejo in an office chair
White boy unhinged, don’t give a fuck, don’t care
Five wheels screamin’, sparks in the air
North Beach yellin’ “yo, get a video of that”
Office chair gangster, no HR file
This chair seen shit, this chair got miles
If life’s a desk job, I fuckin’ quit
Rolled out the building like “suck my dick”
[Outro]
Yeah
North Beach
No brakes
